# Vue

This is a collection of the information I have gathered on [vue.js](vuejs.org)
Right now I'm working on a twitter like application called quarrel

It's more so a replacement for _JQuery_

With vue, we could easily make a desktop application using _Electron_ or a mobile app using _Ionic Vue_

## Single-Page Application

Vue can be used to build **single page web applications(SPA)** which can handle updates whilst also controlling the entire page.

## Sever-side rendering

Vue also supports **server side rendering(SSR)** which makes involves hydrating html templates form the server.

## Vue in action

### Single file components

Vue components can be authored using an HTML-like file format called **Single-File Components(SFC)**
which use the `.vue` extension
